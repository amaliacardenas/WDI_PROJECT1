  //Create your html and basic CSS

    // You need a container to explain the game.
    // You need a container to hold player 1 and player 2 
    //You need to create a grid of 4x3.
    // Inside the grid you need to add buttons for three choices.
    //Add some basic styling to your board so that there is a basic alignmnent.

  // Start the Game
    //Please enter Player 1 name
    //Please enter Player 2 name
    //Randomly assign one of the players to begin the game. 

  // Storing the answers
    //When you select the right answer for one box, give player 1 a point. If the answer is wrong, you cannot select that box again. (Ideally it would be amazing if when you select the right answer, the box flipped over, and revealed a small message of why that lady is awesome.)       

  // Determining a winner
    // If player 1 wins alert: Player 1 is the winner
    //If player 2 wins alert: Player 2 is the winner.
    // If nobody gets the right answer alert: you are terrible at this trivia. Would you like to play again?
